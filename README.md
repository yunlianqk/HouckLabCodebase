# Houck Lab Measurement Code

## Introduction
This is the MATLAB code for communication with measurement equiqments in Houck Lab.

## Purpose
The goal is to encapsulate the lower level equiment codes and provide a unified interface for measurements.
Equipment-indepdent programs can then be built with these interfaces.
Update and maintanence of the code will be done through GitHub.

## Progess
Equipments that have been implemented:

- E8267D microwave generator
- PNAX network analyzer
- YOKOGAWA GS200 voltgae/current source
- U1082A digitizer
- M9330A AWG
